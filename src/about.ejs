          <p>Our story</p>
          <h3>The problem</h3>
          <p>
            Software is eating the world, but one can argue that software can cause just as many problems as it is meant to solve.
            Building software is more than building a product and then selling it. It is a constant, fluid, process of discovery and refinement,
            a process that necessitates nurture and focus. Unfortunately, often times, the result leads to disappointment.
            As a software development community, can we do better? Can we create products that
            are a joy, to not only build, but to <i>maintain</i>, over time? Products that can migrate to new technologies
            and platforms, incrementally?
          </p>
          <p>To that end, all software applications should be built with the following requirements: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scalability</li>
            <li>Extensibility</li>
            <li>Flexibility</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <h3>Weâ€™re here to help</h3>
          <p>
            We are building a new set of products and services that have the potential to transform the software
            community. These products and services provide development teams the guidance and capabilities to, 
            not only, highly perform when building software, but to future proof their products, and create
            constant and consistent value over time.

                Software development is the constant embracement of change as you discover and refine 
                applications to improve the workflow and effectivness of users. Software should empower
                users to get their stuff done leveraging technology, not being driven by technology.
