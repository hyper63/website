  In todays cloud there are so many choices to be made when building an application, 
  sometimes it can lead to a lot of unnecessary churn. hyper63 service framework was 
  built to make the known needs a trivial decision, so your development team can focus 
  on the application development that addresses the users needs. As your product grows, 
  you may need to change/manage cloud services, hyper63 provides you a path to do so 
  without having to modify your application code. This modular design not only gives 
  your development team a future proof design, but empowers the team to make changes 
  quickly without having to touch the backend service layers of their application.

  about where to host and who will manage the dependencies and other details. With 
  the hyper63 saas, your team is free to deal with your products needs.
