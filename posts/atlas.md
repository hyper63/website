# Atlas Toolkit

Atlas Toolkit is a cloud-agnostic opensource backend-service, that creates a boundary between your application logic and your backend. 

With Atlas you can leverage common api's to manage your data persistence, caching and file storage, then choose the backend adapters that fit your needs the best at the time. This common api - specific adapter pattern gives your team the flexibility to change in the future as things change over time.
